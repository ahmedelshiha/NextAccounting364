## 15) Repo Alignment Notes (for our codebase)
- [ ] If reusing next-themes, adapt ThemeSubmenu to use existing theme provider; otherwise add ThemeProvider per guide
- [ ] Consider reusing existing MFA endpoints (/api/auth/mfa/*) instead of adding parallel ones; reconcile API plan during implementation
- [ ] If deferring new UserProfile model, scope UI to data available from /api/users/me and add extended fields later
- [ ] Preserve existing styles and spacing in AdminHeader and ui/navigation; do not alter unrelated styling

## 16) Enhancements & Gaps (added by review)
- Accessibility & UX
  - [x] Return focus to trigger after dropdown/panel close
  - [x] Add aria-live status announcements for theme/status/profile save
  - [x] Ensure role="menuitemradio" and aria-checked on theme/status items
  - [ ] Modal: trap focus, make background inert; test mobile screen readers
- Internationalization
  - [ ] Externalize all strings (menu items, badges, errors) to i18n; add RTL checks
- Status experience
  - [ ] Listen to window online/offline and reflect offline status (read-only)
  - [ ] Document auto-away behavior and provide "busy" override that disables auto-away
- Toasts & errors
  - [ ] Use Toaster to display success/error for profile/security actions; map common server errors
- Hooks tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for useUserStatus (auto-away, persistence), useUserProfile (loading/error/update), useSecuritySettings (processing, API paths)
- Panel polish
  - [ ] Code-split ProfileManagementPanel; prefetch on hover/first open intent
  - [ ] Add skeleton placeholders for panel fields while loading
  - [ ] Support swipe-to-close on mobile and backdrop click to close (with confirm on dirty state)
  - [x] Persist last-active-tab in localStorage
- Security & auditing
  - [ ] Add audit logs on profile/security updates (action keys consistent: user.profile.update, mfa.enroll, mfa.verify)
  - [x] Ensure CSRF protection on mutations where applicable
- RBAC/visibility
  - [x] Conditionally render links (Billing/API Keys) based on user permissions/feature flags
- Account activity
  - [ ] Wire "Account activity" row to a simple viewer of recent audit events (last 10)
- Keyboard Shortcuts
  - [ ] Provide /admin/shortcuts page or modal; update Help link accordingly
- Theme
  - [x] Emit a custom "themechange" event (or document next-themes behavior) for any consumers
  - [ ] Test system-theme change listener (prefers-color-scheme) and persistence
- Performance
  - [ ] Fix avatar container sizes to prevent CLS; pre-size images
  - [ ] Defer non-critical icons; ensure dropdown bundle stays < 50KB gz
- Analytics (optional)
  - [ ] Track menu open, theme changes, status changes, profile saves for product analytics

## 17) Open Decisions
- [ ] Storage strategy for extended profile fields (new model vs JSON extension)
- [ ] Scope and timeline for phone verification, passkeys, device sign-in UI → API parity
- [ ] Single shared menu across admin/portal vs role-specific variations

### Post-Deployment Verification (First 24 Hours)

#### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Monitor Sentry for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Check server logs for API errors
- [ ] Verify database queries are performing well
- [ ] Monitor API response times (target < 300ms)
- [ ] Check for 4xx and 5xx errors in server logs
- [ ] Review audit logs for profile updates
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting triggers

#### Functional Testing
- [ ] Open user dropdown in production
- [ ] Change theme and verify persistence
- [ ] Change status and verify dot color updates
- [ ] Click "Manage Profile" and verify panel opens
- [ ] Edit profile field and save changes
- [ ] Verify email verification flow works
- [ ] Test 2FA enrollment flow
- [ ] Test sign out and redirect to login

#### User Feedback
- [ ] Monitor support tickets for user issues
- [ ] Check user feedback on profile management experience
- [ ] Verify no unexpected user behavior
- [ ] Collect metrics on feature adoption

#### Security Audit
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs or console
- [ ] Check for XSS vulnerabilities (test with special characters)
- [ ] Verify CSRF tokens are being sent and validated
- [ ] Test with browser devtools to ensure no secrets exposed
- [ ] Run automated security scan (OWASP)

#### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor bundle size doesn't exceed limits
- [ ] Track Core Web Vitals in production
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Check database query performance
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks in long sessions

### Ongoing Maintenance

#### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor error rates weekly
- [ ] Review performance metrics monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies quarterly
- [ ] Conduct security audits quarterly
- [ ] Review and update localization strings as needed

#### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add phone number verification
- [ ] Implement passkeys/WebAuthn

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Monitor error rates and user feedback
   - If error rate > 5%, prepare rollback

2. **Rollback Steps**
   - Revert to previous git commit
   - Run database migration rollback (if schema changed)
   - Clear CDN cache
   - Verify on staging before deploying to production
   - Monitor for 24 hours

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Create hotfix on develop branch
   - Test thoroughly before re-deploying
   - Update documentation
