# Unified RBAC & User Management Consolidation Plan

**Centralize Everything to /admin/users**

**Status:** 📋 Planning Phase (Revised Scope)  
**Created:** January 2025  
**Revision Type:** MAJOR SCOPE CHANGE  
**Vision:** Single Hub for User Management, RBAC, Clients, and Team

### Progress Update (2025-10-31)
- Status: ✅ Completed initial RBAC consolidation
- Summary: Added “Roles & Permissions” tab to unified /admin/users and redirected legacy RBAC pages.
- Files modified/added:
  - src/app/admin/permissions/page.tsx (server redirect to /admin/users?tab=rbac)
  - src/app/admin/roles/page.tsx (server redirect to /admin/users?tab=rbac)
  - src/app/admin/users/components/tabs/RbacTab.tsx (new)
  - src/app/admin/users/components/tabs/index.ts (export RbacTab)
  - src/app/admin/users/components/TabNavigation.tsx (added rbac tab)
  - src/app/admin/users/EnterpriseUsersPage.tsx (wired RbacTab and URL tab param)
- Testing notes: Manually verified navigation to /admin/permissions and /admin/roles redirects to /admin/users?tab=rbac; verified tab activation from URL (?tab=rbac) and RBAC UI renders both RolePermissionsViewer and UserPermissionsInspector.
- Issues: None observed. Backward-compatible; old pages now forward to unified hub.
- Next tasks: E2E coverage for redirects and RBAC tab.

### Progress Update (2025-10-31 - Part 2)
- Status: ✅ Added Entities tab with Clients and Team sub-tabs
- Summary: Embedded Clients list (via /api/admin/users?role=CLIENT) and Team management (existing component) inside unified /admin/users. Extracted shared hooks (useListState, useListFilters) for Clients list to reduce duplication and prepare reuse.
- Files modified/added:
  - src/app/admin/users/components/tabs/EntitiesTab.tsx (new)
  - src/app/admin/users/components/tabs/index.ts (export EntitiesTab)
  - src/app/admin/users/components/TabNavigation.tsx (added entities tab)
  - src/app/admin/users/EnterpriseUsersPage.tsx (wired EntitiesTab, URL param parsing)
  - src/app/admin/clients/page.tsx (server redirect to /admin/users?tab=entities&type=clients)
  - src/app/admin/team/page.tsx (server redirect to /admin/users?tab=entities&type=team)
- Testing notes: Manually verified /admin/clients and /admin/team redirect to the Entities tab with correct sub-tab selection; verified search and filters on clients; verified team list renders and CRUD actions hit existing APIs.
- Issues: None observed. Backward-compatible.
- Next tasks: Optional further refactors.

### Service Unification (2025-10-31)
- Added shared hooks: src/hooks/admin/useListState.ts, src/hooks/admin/useListFilters.ts
- Added services: src/services/client.service.ts, src/services/team-member.service.ts
- Refactored EntitiesTab to use ClientService for list load
- Refactored TeamManagement mutations (create/update/delete/toggle) to use TeamMemberService
- Backward compatible; APIs unchanged

### Validation Update (2025-10-31)
- Added E2E tests: e2e/tests/admin-unified-redirects.spec.ts
- Covers: redirects for /admin/{permissions,roles,clients,team} and presence of Entities/RBAC tabs
- Status: ✅ Basic validation added; extend a11y tests later if needed

## Executive Summary

### Current State (Fragmented)
- `/admin/users` - Enterprise user management (Phase 4, 5 tabs)
- `/admin/clients` - Basic client list (400 lines)
- `/admin/team` - Team member management (600+ lines)
- `/admin/permissions` - View-only permissions UI (28 lines)
- `/admin/roles` - View-only roles UI (25 lines)

**Problem:** 5 separate pages manage interconnected entities. Users must navigate between pages to manage related data.

### Proposed Solution
Create a **Unified RBAC & Entity Management Hub** at `/admin/users` that consolidates:
- ✅ User Management (already exists - Phase 4)
- ✅ Client Management (migrate from `/admin/clients`)
- ✅ Team Member Management (migrate from `/admin/team`)
- ✅ Role & Permission Management (integrate `/admin/permissions` + `/admin/roles`)
- ✅ Approval Workflows (already in admin tab)
- ✅ Audit Logging (already in audit tab)

### Expected Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth** for all RBAC & entity management
- **Reduced Navigation** - One page, multiple tabs instead of 5 pages
- **Integrated Workflows** - Manage users, assign roles, update clients in context
- **Consistent UX** - All entities use same patterns, filters, modals
- **Improved Maintenance** - One page to update instead of 5
- **Code Consolidation** - Retire 4 separate pages (~2500 lines)

### Business Impact
- Faster user onboarding (less page navigation)
- More efficient admin workflows
- Lower maintenance overhead
- Clear data relationships visible in one interface
- 40%+ code reduction for admin pages

### Key Architecture Changes

#### 1. Entity Type Abstraction
```typescript
// Unified entity types
type EntityType = 'USER' | 'CLIENT' | 'TEAM_MEMBER'

interface BaseEntity {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  status: 'ACTIVE' | 'INACTIVE' | 'SUSPENDED'
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

interface User extends BaseEntity {
  role: string
  permissions: string[]
  workflows: UserWorkflow[]
}

interface Client extends BaseEntity {
  company?: string
  tier: 'INDIVIDUAL' | 'SMB' | 'ENTERPRISE'
  revenue?: number
  lastBooking?: Date
}

interface TeamMember extends BaseEntity {
  title: string
  department: string
  specialties: string[]
  availability: WorkingHours
  stats: TeamStats
}
```

#### 2. Unified Service Layer
```typescript
// Services per entity
EntityService<T>
��── UserService (extends EntityService)
├── ClientService (extends EntityService)
├── TeamMemberService (extends EntityService)
└── RolePermissionService (new)

// Shared interfaces
RolePermissionService
├── getRoles()
├── createRole()
├── updateRole()
├── deleteRole()
├── assignPermissions()
├── getPermissions()
└── getEffectivePermissions()
```

#### 3. Unified API Routes
```
/api/admin/entities/
├── users/          (existing + enhanced)
├── clients/        (migrate from /api/admin/clients)
├── team-members/   (migrate from /api/admin/team)
├── roles/          (new unified route)
└── permissions/    (new unified route)
```

#### 4. Shared Tab Infrastructure
```typescript
// Reusable tab structure
type Tab = 'dashboard' | 'entities' | 'rbac' | 'workflows' | 
           'bulk-operations' | 'audit' | 'settings'

// Shared navigation logic
TabContext: {
  activeTab: Tab
  setActiveTab: (tab: Tab) => void
  tabHistory: Tab[]
  goBack: () => void
}
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Breaking Phase 4 Implementation
**Severity:** High | **Probability:** Medium

**Description:** Changes to existing user management affect Phase 4 features (workflows, bulk ops, audit).

**Mitigation:**
- Phase 4 remains untouched in Phase 0-1
- New tabs added alongside existing ones
- Comprehensive testing before merging
- Rollback plan ready

**Owner:** Lead Architect

#### Risk 2: Data Migration Issues
**Severity:** High | **Probability:** Low

**Description:** Migrating clients/team data to unified schema causes data loss or conflicts.

**Mitigation:**
- Test migrations on staging first
- Backup before migration
- Validation checks post-migration
- Rollback procedures documented
- Slow rollout to users

**Owner:** Senior Developer 1

#### Risk 3: API Breaking Changes
**Severity:** Medium | **Probability:** Medium

**Description:** Old API clients break when routes change.

**Mitigation:**
- Keep old routes as shims during Phase 3
- Deprecation period (6 months)
- Clear migration guide for clients
- Version API routes if needed

**Owner:** Senior Developer 1

#### Risk 4: Performance Degradation
**Severity:** Medium | **Probability:** Low

**Description:** Unified page with 7 tabs slower than separate pages.

**Mitigation:**
- Lazy load tabs
- Virtual scrolling for lists
- Cache management
- Performance testing Phase 2+
- Monitoring post-launch

**Owner:** Senior Developer 2

### Project Risks

#### Risk 5: Scope Creep
**Severity:** High | **Probability:** High

**Description:** New features requested during consolidation extend timeline.

**Mitigation:**
- Strict scope (consolidation only, no new features)
- "Phase 5" backlog for new features
- Weekly scope reviews
- Clear "in-scope" vs "out-of-scope"

**Owner:** Lead Architect

#### Risk 6: Team Availability
**Severity:** High | **Probability:** Medium

**Description:** Key team members unavailable during 10-week project.

**Mitigation:**
- Block calendars in advance
- Identify backup developers
- Clear handoff documentation
- Pair programming approach

**Owner:** Project Manager

#### Risk 7: Testing Coverage
**Severity:** Medium | **Probability:** Medium

**Description:** Insufficient test coverage before launch leads to production bugs.

**Mitigation:**
- Target >90% code coverage
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Performance testing Phase 2+
- User acceptance testing Phase 3
- Staged rollout to users

**Owner:** QA Engineer

## Integration Points with Phase 4

### Preserved Features
```
Dashboard Tab (Phase 4a)
├── User list & selection ✅ ENHANCED
│   └─ Add client/team bulk operations
│   └─ Note: Dashboard displays a ➕ "Add user" icon in the quick-actions area. The icon is present in the UI but is not yet wired to the create-user flow (see migration tasks below).
├── Pending operations ✅ MAINTAINED
├── Quick actions ✅ ENHANCED
│   └─ Add client/team actions
│   └─ The existing create-user flow currently lives at `/admin/clients/new` (working implementation). As part of consolidation we will migrate this flow into the unified Users dashboard (either as a Users create modal or routed form) and preserve backwards compatibility via shims/redirects.
└── Stats cards ✅ ENHANCED
   └─ Include client/team metrics

Migration tasks (dashboard add-user):
- Migrate the create-user form from `/admin/clients/new` into the Users dashboard (Dashboard quick action or Entities sub-tab) and ensure parity of fields, validation, and server-side handling.
- Wire the ➕ Add user icon to open the Users create modal or navigate to the unified create route.
- Preserve the existing `/admin/clients/new` route as a temporary shim that redirects to the new create flow with a clear deprecation period.
- Add E2E tests to verify the Add user flow from the dashboard quick-action, from Entities tab, and via the legacy route.
- Ensure RBAC checks and audit logging are applied for user creation in the unified flow.

### Modal & Component Deduplication Audit

Finding summary:
- Existing components relevant to user creation and management:
  - UserProfileDialog (src/app/admin/users/components/UserProfileDialog) — used to view/edit user details.
  - UnifiedPermissionModal (src/components/admin/permissions/UnifiedPermissionModal.tsx) — single permission modal used across user/role flows.
  - Client creation flow (src/app/admin/clients/new/page.tsx) — includes the working create-user API call and client onboarding form used today.
- Risk: Creating a new standalone "CreateUserModal" for the unified Users page would duplicate validation, form fields, and submit logic already present in the clients/new flow and the UserProfileDialog edit flow.

Recommendations to avoid duplication:
1. Extract a single reusable UserForm component (e.g., src/components/admin/shared/UserForm.tsx) that contains:
   - All form fields required for user creation and editing (name, email, role, temporary password generation options, onboarding flags, preferences)
   - Centralized validation using existing Zod schemas (reuse or extend schemas from src/schemas/clients and create src/schemas/users as needed)
   - A single submit handler interface (onCreate, onUpdate callbacks) that callers can implement to call the appropriate API (/api/auth/register or unified /api/admin/entities/users)
2. Replace inline form code in /admin/clients/new with the new UserForm to preserve existing create flow while enabling reuse.
3. Implement a lightweight CreateUserModal that simply wraps UserForm and handles modal presentation; use the same modal component for dashboard quick-action and Entities tab create button.
4. Reuse existing UserProfileDialog for editing users (it should consume the same UserForm component in edit mode or delegate to a dedicated EditUserForm wrapper).
5. Keep UnifiedPermissionModal as the single source of truth for permission changes — do not create additional permission modal variants.
6. Centralize permission and role saving logic in src/app/admin/users/hooks/useUserPermissions.ts and reuse it across UnifiedPermissionModal and any role/permission UI.
7. Lazy-load heavy modal wrappers (CreateUserModal, UserProfileDialog, UnifiedPermissionModal) with dynamic imports and Suspense to avoid bundle inflation.
8. Add migration and refactor tasks to Phase 2/3 to ensure changes are incremental and verified:
   - Phase 2: Extract UserForm and user schemas; update /admin/clients/new to use it (smoke test)
   - Phase 2: Create CreateUserModal wrapper and wire dashboard quick-action to open it (feature-flagged)
   - Phase 3: Replace any duplicate inline forms across the admin area with the shared UserForm; remove retired code
   - Add E2E coverage for Add User flow from dashboard, entities tab, and legacy route

Missing items identified:
- Centralized user Zod schema (src/schemas/users) — currently client schemas exist but user schema parity is not guaranteed. Create and reconcile schemas.
- Shared UserForm component does not exist yet and should be implemented before wiring the dashboard Add action.
- Tests: unit tests for UserForm validation and integration tests for the modal flows are missing and must be added.

Implementation notes:
- Maintain existing API compatibility by keeping /admin/clients/new as a shim until the unified flow is feature-complete.
- Ensure RBAC checks are performed on server-side routes (both old and new endpoints) — do not rely solely on client-side guards.
- Preserve audit logging when moving create-user logic by ensuring server endpoints call AuditLogService or equivalent.

Action items (short):
- Create src/components/admin/shared/UserForm.tsx and src/schemas/users.ts
- Refactor src/app/admin/clients/new/page.tsx to use UserForm
- Implement CreateUserModal wrapper and wire quick-action (feature flagged)
- Add E2E tests for add-user flows and unit tests for UserForm
- Remove duplicate form code during Phase 3 cleanup
