## Critical Path Analysis

```
Critical Path (No Buffer):
Quick Fix → Dashboard → Workflows → Bulk Ops → Audit → Release
Days:  0    14        28        42        56      63      70

Minimum Days: 10 weeks (70 calendar days)
With Buffer:  13 weeks (91 calendar days)
Recommended:  9-10 weeks elapsed (with full team)
```

**Critical Dependencies (Can't be Parallel):**
1. Database schema must exist before Phase 1
2. Dashboard must exist before Workflows
3. Workflows must exist before Bulk Ops
4. All features must exist before Polish/Release

**Can Run in Parallel:**
- UI component development (different team members)
- API endpoint development
- Test automation setup
- Documentation writing
