## Detailed Component Audit

### Tab Navigation

**Current State:**
- Uses native HTML `<button>` elements for tabs
- Tab content is conditionally rendered

**Improvements Needed:**
```tsx
// Add ARIA attributes
<div role="tablist" aria-label="Localization Settings Tabs">
  <button
    role="tab"
    aria-selected={activeTab === 'languages'}
    aria-controls="languages-panel"
    id="languages-tab"
  >
    Languages
  </button>
</div>

<div
  role="tabpanel"
  id="languages-panel"
  aria-labelledby="languages-tab"
>
  {/* Tab content */}
</div>
```

### Forms

**Current State:**
- FormField components handle label associations
- Toggle and select components used throughout

**Improvements Needed:**
- [ ] Add `aria-required` to required fields
- [ ] Add `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` to fields with errors
- [ ] Ensure form instructions are associated with form controls
- [ ] Add fieldset/legend for grouped options

### Data Tables

**Current State:**
- LanguagesTable displays language data
- No explicit table headers

**Improvements Needed:**
```tsx
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Language Code</th>
      <th scope="col">Native Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Status</th>
      <th scope="col">Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {/* rows */}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Charts

**Current State:**
- AnalyticsTab displays charts for adoption trends
- LanguageUsageChart shows distribution

**Improvements Needed:**
- [ ] Provide data table alternative to charts
- [ ] Add descriptive captions to charts
- [ ] Include summary statistics in text format
- [ ] High contrast chart colors

**Example:**
```tsx
<figure>
  <figcaption>User language distribution - Last 30 days</figcaption>
  <AnalyticsChart data={data} />
  <details>
    <summary>View data as table</summary>
    <table>{/* Accessible data table */}</table>
  </details>
</figure>
```

### Modals & Dialogs

**Current State:**
- Import/Export modals exist
- Need accessibility review

**Requirements:**
- [ ] `role="dialog"` or `role="alertdialog"`
- [ ] `aria-modal="true"`
- [ ] `aria-labelledby` pointing to title
- [ ] Focus trap (focus stays within dialog)
- [ ] Escape key closes dialog
- [ ] Focus returns to trigger element when closed

test('localization settings page has no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<LocalizationContent />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```
