## Action Log (Real-Time Updates)

### ✅ 2025-10-22 — 14.1.2 Admin Language Management UI — Completed
- Summary: Implemented full admin UI and APIs to manage languages (list, create, update, delete, enable/disable), gated by new permissions.
- Files added:
  - src/app/api/admin/languages/route.ts (GET, POST)
  - src/app/api/admin/languages/[code]/route.ts (PUT, DELETE)
  - src/app/api/admin/languages/[code]/toggle/route.ts (PATCH)
  - src/app/admin/settings/languages/page.tsx (admin UI page)
- Files updated:
  - src/lib/permissions.ts (added LANGUAGES_VIEW, LANGUAGES_MANAGE)
- Key implementation details:
  - Uses language-registry service (getAllLanguages, upsertLanguage, deleteLanguage, toggleLanguageStatus)
  - Zod-validated payloads; strict code/locale formats; lowercase normalization for codes
  - Permission gating via PERMISSIONS.LANGUAGES_VIEW/LANGUAGES_MANAGE; ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN inherit automatically
  - UI follows existing SettingsShell pattern; inline create and row-level edit/toggle/delete
- Issues encountered:
  - None blocking. Reused existing settings components to keep UX consistent
- Testing notes:
  - Manual: created a new language (fr), toggled enable, edited BCP47, and deleted; verified API responses and UI updates
  - Next steps: add unit tests for API handlers and e2e coverage in settings navigation
