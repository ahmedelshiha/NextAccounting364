## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How many users can I manage at once?**

A: System tested with 10,000+ users. Performance stays good. For bulk operations, recommended batch size is 500-1000 users.

---

**Q: How long are audit logs kept?**

A: Default is 90 days. Admin can change in settings. Older logs can be archived.

---

**Q: Can I undo a user deletion?**

A: No, deletion is permanent. But audit logs show who was deleted and when. Data is archived.

---

**Q: What happens when I change a user's role?**

A: Permissions change immediately. Old permissions revoked. New permissions granted. Audit log created.

---

**Q: Can I schedule workflows for later?**

A: Yes! When creating workflow, click "Schedule" and choose date/time. Workflow runs automatically at that time.

---

### Workflow Questions

**Q: What if a workflow step fails?**

A: Workflow pauses. You get notification. Can retry failed step or cancel workflow.

---

**Q: Can I create my own workflow?**

A: Yes! Click "New Workflow" and build from scratch. Or clone existing template.

---

**Q: How do I approve workflows I created?**

A: You can't approve your own workflow. Must be different user (set as approver). Prevents conflicts of interest.

---

### Bulk Operations Questions

**Q: Can I test before executing bulk operation?**

A: Yes! Click "Preview" (dry run) to see what would change without making changes.

---

**Q: What if bulk operation affects the wrong users?**

A: Can't undo, but audit log shows exactly what changed. Can manually revert if needed.

---

**Q: Can I stop a bulk operation in progress?**

A: Yes! Click "Cancel" button. Already processed users keep changes. Not yet processed are skipped.

---

### Audit Questions

**Q: Are all actions logged?**

A: Yes! Every user management action is logged. Logins, changes, deletions, everything.

---

**Q: Can I modify audit logs?**

A: No. Audit logs are immutable (can't be changed). Prevents tampering. You can only view and export.

---

**Q: How do I know who viewed a user's profile?**

A: Check audit logs. Search for user ID. Shows all view actions with timestamp and user.

---

**Q: Can I export partial audit logs?**

A: Yes! Use filters first (date, action, user) then export. Only filtered logs are exported.

---

### Permission Questions

**Q: What's the difference between roles and permissions?**

A: Roles are bundles of permissions. Assigning a role gives all its permissions. Permissions are individual capabilities.

---

**Q: Can a user have multiple roles?**

A: In this version, one role per user. Future versions may support multiple roles.

---

**Q: What permissions do I need to manage users?**

A: USERS_MANAGE permission. Usually given to admins and team leads.

---

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: I get "Rate limit exceeded" - what does it mean?**

A: You're making too many requests. System limits to 100 per minute. Wait 1 minute and retry.

---

**Q: Why is export limited to 5 per minute?**

A: Protects system from overload. Exports are resource-intensive. Limit prevents abuse.

---

**Q: I forgot my password - what do I do?**

A: Click "Forgot Password" on login page. Enter email. Reset link sent to email. Click link to set new password.

---

**Q: My account is locked - why?**

A: Too many failed login attempts (more than 5). Locked for 15 minutes for security. Try again later.
