### Common Issues

**Issue**: Theme not persisting
- **Solution**: Check localStorage permissions, verify next-themes setup

**Issue**: Status changes not syncing
- **Solution**: Verify useUserStatus hook, check localStorage, restart browser

**Issue**: Profile save fails
- **Solution**: Check CSRF token, verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET, check rate limits

**Issue**: 2FA not working
- **Solution**: Verify authenticator time sync, check TOTP implementation
